# What Do Single-view 3D Reconstruction Networks Learn?

![thumbnail](img/thumb.png)

Evaluation and visualization code accompanying the CVPR'19 paper ["What Do Single-view 3D Reconstruction Networks Learn?"](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Publications/2019/TB19/paper-s3d.pdf) by M. Tatarchenko*, S. R. Richter*, R. Ranftl, Z. Li, V. Koltun, and T. Brox (*indicates equal contribution).

### Dependencies

* [Open 3D](https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D)
* numpy
* matplotlib

### Setup

We provide multiple data modalities used for the **viewer-centered** experiments in our paper: voxel grids, point clouds, renderings and [train/test splits](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/data/what3d/splits.zip).

To run the F-score evaluation code, you will only need the *point clouds* and the *train/test splits*. Unpack the archives into your desired location and update the `BASE_DATA_PATH` variable in the `path_config.py` file with this location. The resulting structure of your data folder should look like

```
data/
    points/
    lists/
    classes.txt
```

### F-score evalution

You can evaluate the predictions of your method by running

```
$ python eval.py --pr_path path_to_your_predictions
```

The `path_to_your_predictions` folder should contain the `.ply` point clouds organized in the same structure as the `data/points/` folder.
By default, the F-score is calculated with the same threshold values as in the paper. If you want use a different threshold, you can do so by providing a `--th` parameter to the script. You can also specify the desired location for the results by setting the `--out_path` parameter. If you do not do it, the results will be stored in the `fscore` folder.

### Precision/recall visualization

![precision-recall](img/precision_recall.png)

You can produce the precision/recall visualizations of your reconstructions similar to the one above by running

```
$ python vis.py --gt path_to_gt_cloud.ply --pr path_to_pr_cloud.ply
```

Point color denotes the point-to-point distance ranging from low (white) to high (black). By default the scaling of the color map is determined automatically based on the maximum point-to-point distance between the two point clouds. Instead, you can additionally pass the `--th` parameter to the script. Its value will be used both as a maximum distance for color map scaling and as a threshold for F-score computation.
